# Digi21.DigiNG.Topology

This package contains a reference assembly with types for geometric and topological analysis with [Digi3D.NET](https://www.digi21.net/Digi3D).

The actual runtime assembly is provided by the Digi3D.NET installation. If you're developing a standalone aplication, consider to add a reference to the NuGet package [Digi21.Digi3D.App](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Digi21.Digi3D.App) to automatically add a reference to Digi3D's installation directory in your _.runtimeconfig.json_ file so your application will be able to run from any directory.

A Digi3D.NET license is required to run applications that use the assemblies published by this package. [Rent](https://www.digi21.net/Tienda/Alquiler) or [buy](https://www.digi21.net/Tienda/Compra) a license.
